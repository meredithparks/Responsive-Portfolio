      <p>My name is Meredith Parks. I am a Web Developer currently residing in Denver, Colorado. I was born in Providence, Rhode Island and have lived in several states, including Massachusetts and Texas.</p>

      <p>I was a liberal arts major in college and currently work as an Account Manager for a payroll software company, Gusto in Denver. I love working for Gusto. It is a great company with a fantastic company culture. </p>
    
      <p> I wanted to become a Full-Stack Web Developer to challenege myself and become more competitive in the job market. I believe web development and coding are some of the most valuable skills to have in this day in age.</p>
    
      <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing with my French Bulldog, Stella. Since I live in Denver, I have grown to love hiking and going to the mountains. Some of my hobbies include- tennis, running, yoga, and reading.</p>
